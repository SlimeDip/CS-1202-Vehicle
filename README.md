## ❓ What is this program about?
This program demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python by simulating vehicles and their functionalities. The program includes features such as:
- 🔧 **Make your own vehicle**
- 🧰 **Garage for vehicle selection**
- 🚦 **Drive**
- 🔑 **Start Engine**
- 🛑 **Stop Engine**
- ⛽ **Refuel**

It uses an abstract base class (`Vehicle`) and subclasses (`Car`, `Motorcycle`) to showcase inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.
