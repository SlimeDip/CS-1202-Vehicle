## ‚ùì What is this program about?
This program demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python by simulating vehicles and their functionalities. It allows users to:

- üîß **Create your own vehicle**  
  Design a vehicle by specifying its name, speed, and fuel type. Choose from different types of vehicles.

- üß∞ **Manage a garage**  
  View and manage a collection of vehicles you have created. Select a vehicle to drive.

- üö¶ **Drive your vehicle**  
  Simulate driving your vehicle while keeping track of fuel consumption. Ensure you have enough fuel before driving!

- ‚õΩ **Refuel your vehicle**  
  Refill your vehicle's fuel tank when it runs out, so you can continue driving.

This program uses an abstract base class (`Vehicle`) and subclasses (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`) to demonstrate key OOP principles such as:
- **Inheritance**: Sharing common functionality across different types of vehicles.
- **Abstraction**: Defining a blueprint for vehicles with abstract methods.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing different vehicle types to implement their own behavior for shared methods.

2. Open the project folder in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Run the `Vehicle.py` script:
   ```bash
   python Vehicle.py
