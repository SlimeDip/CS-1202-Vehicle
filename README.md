# üöó Ultimate Vehicle Simulator üõ•Ô∏è

**Ultimate Vehicle Simulator** by **Group 1 from CS-1202** is a simple program designed to showcase the fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. It serves as both a vehicle maker and simulator, allowing users to create, manage, and interact with various types of vehicles in a virtual environment.

## ‚ùì What is this program about?
This program demonstrates the use of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in Python by simulating vehicles and their functionalities. It allows users to:

- üîß **Create your own vehicle**  
  Design a vehicle by specifying its name, speed, and fuel type. Choose from different types of vehicles.

- üß∞ **Manage your vehicles**  
  View and manage a collection of vehicles you have created. View your garage or dock to select a vehicle to drive.

- üö¶ **Drive your vehicle**  
  Simulate driving your vehicle while keeping track of fuel consumption. Make sure that you have enough fuel before driving.

- ‚õΩ **Refuel your vehicle**  
  Refill your vehicle's fuel tank when it runs out, so you can continue driving.

This program uses an abstract base class (`Vehicle`) and subclasses (`Car`, `Motorcycle`, `Bus`, `Truck`,`Speedboat`, `Jetski`) to demonstrate key OOP principles such as:
- **Inheritance**: Sharing common functionality across different types of vehicles.
- **Abstraction**: Defining a blueprint for vehicles with abstract methods.
- **Polymorphism**: Allowing different vehicle types to implement their own behavior for shared methods.
